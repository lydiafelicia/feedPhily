			<h3>About Feeding Philly </h3>
			<br>
			<img src="images/about1.jpg">
			<div id="p-left1">
			<p>Feeding Philly is a nationwide network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs that provides food and services to people each year. Together, we are the Philadelphia's leading domestic hunger-relief organization. </p>

			<p>The process of getting food to hungry Philadelphians requires a dynamic infrastructure and sophisticated management. We secures donations from national food and grocery manufacturers, retailers, shippers, packers and growers and from government agencies and other organizations. We then moves donated food and grocery product to member food banks.</p>

			<p>The food banks in turn distribute food and grocery items through food pantries and meal programs that serve families, children, seniors and others at risk of hunger. Last year alone, the Feeding Philly network distributed more than 3 billion meals to people in need.</p>

			<p>We also supports programs that improve food security among the people we serve; educates the public about the problem of hunger; and advocates for legislation that protects people from going hungry. Individuals, charities, businesses and government all have a role in ending hunger.</p>
			
			<p>Together, we can make a difference to help families in need.</p>

			<h3>How We Work</h3>
			<br>
			<img src="images/about2.jpg">
			<div id="p-left2">
			<p>Each year in Philadelphia, roughly 10 billion pounds of good, safe food goes to waste. The loss occurs at every stage of the food production and distribution system from farmers to packers and shippers, to manufacturers and retailers. Feeding Philly has the logistical expertise and strategic relationships necessary to rescue this food before it's lost and help it get to people in need. </p>

			<p>Included in the amount of food wasted each year is approximately 6 billion pounds of fresh produce. Feeding Philly works to rescue some of this lost produce through dedicated produce programs, as well as secure donated produce from retailers and manufacturers. Last year alone, we secured a total of 967 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables for people in need. </p>

			<p>Of this number, approximately 587 million pounds were secured through our produce strategies alone. The success of our produce strategies has been tremendous. We then sort and distribute the food to more than 50,000 food pantries around the city. By providing people in need with healthy, nutritious food we can not only help them get enough to eat, but also give them hope for a brighter, healthier future.</p>
